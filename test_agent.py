#Would you like me to also show you a bonus:
#how to simulate different flows like:

#Patient says wrong email first and repeats it again
#Patient asks for a Sunday appointment and AI politely denies



#Test-cases:
# 1. Test with a clear audio file where the patient clearly states the date, time, and email. (e.g, a normal appointment request)
# 2. Test with a noisy audio file where the patient states the date, time, and email but with background noise.
# 3. Test with a file where the patient spells their email correctly.
# 4. Test with a file where the patient spells their email incorrectly.
# 5. Test with a file where the patient says "yes" to confirm the appointment.
# 6. Test with a file where the patient says "no" to confirm the appointment.
# 7. Test with a file where the patient asks for a Sunday appointment.
# 8. Test with a file where the patient asks for an appointment outside of business hours.
# 9. Test with a file where the patient asks for an appointment but doesn't provide a date or time.(e.g, "I want to book an appointment.")
# 10. Test with a file where the patient provides a date and time but doesn't confirm the appointment.
# 11. Test with a file where the patient provides a date and time but the appointment slot is already booked.
# 12. Test with a file where the patient provides a date and time but the appointment is outside of business hours.
# 13. Test with a file where the patient doesn't provides 'yes' or 'no' to confirm the appointment.



#Glitch:
# 1. Confirm_no audio output is not that much accurate.
# 2. Confirmation_audio output is not that much accurate.
# 3. calendar event link double aari h patient yaa doctor ke email pe.
# 4. wrong_time_audio dene k bad jb right audio de rha hun toh woh phir se wrong_time_audio hi transcribe kar raha hai.



#Result:
# All the test case runs perfectly fine. Only one thing is missing that's a max_retry limit. That should be added in the test_agent.py file.
